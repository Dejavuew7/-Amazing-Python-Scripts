# Dot Connect
Dot Connect is a two-player game where players compete to create boxes by connecting dots with lines. 

## Game Objective
The objective of Dot Connect is to score the most points by creating boxes on the game grid. A box is formed when a player closes it with the fourth line. Each completed box scores a point for the player who created it.

## Rules
1. Dot Grid: The game is played on a square grid consisting of dots. The grid is divided into cells, and each cell contains a dot.

2. Turns: Players take turns to make moves. Player A goes first, followed by Player B.

3. Making a Move: On their turn, a player clicks on an empty space between two adjacent dots to draw a line. The line can be drawn horizontally or vertically.

4. Completing a Box: When a player's line closes a box, they score a point and get an additional turn. The player's name is displayed inside the completed box.

5. Multiple Box Completion: If a player completes multiple boxes in a single turn, they score points for each box and continue their turn.

6. Game End: The game continues until all the boxes on the grid are completed. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score wins.
