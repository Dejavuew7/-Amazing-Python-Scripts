# Script to organise files according to their extensions


- The script on running would ask for a Path directory
- If no Path is entered then it will take current working directory as the path.
- On running this script the files in a directory will be put into different subdirectories as per their extensions.

## Setup instructions

- The script doesn't require any installations and is not dependent on any OS.
- Just running the script and giving the desired input will do.
