# Reddit Meme Scraper

This script locates and downloads images from several subreddits (r/deepfriedmemes, r/surrealmemes, r/nukedmemes, r/bigbangedmemes, r/wackytictacs, r/bonehurtingjuice) into your local system.

For the sake of simplicity (and so that your system doesn't get stuffed full of images), the **download is limited to 25 (total) images per run**.
However, you are **welcome to modify that limit** to whatever amount you'd like or **remove it** altogether, but then make sure you **update `sg.ProgressBar()`** so it properly represents the download progress.

## Usage

Make sure you have installed the **necessary packages** listed in `requirements.txt`, then simply run `script.py`.
You'll be greeted by a popup window asking where to download the images, after which the download will commence.

## Screenshots
