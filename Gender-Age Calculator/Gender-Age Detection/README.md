# GENDER-AGE DETECTION

## DESCRIPTION

The objective of this project is to identify the gender and approximate age of a person given in an image automatically.

## PROJECT REQUISITES

To build this project we will use

- Deep Learning to accurately identify the gender and age of a person from a single image of a face.
- We will use this [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ttungl/adience-benchmark-gender-and-age-classification)
- The predicted gender may be one of ‘Male’ and ‘Female’, and the predicted age may be one of the following 8 ranges- (0 – 2), (4 – 6), (8 – 12), (15 – 20), (25 – 32), (38 – 43), (48 – 53), (60 – 100).

## PROJECT STRUCTURE

These are the step to build Gender-Age Detection python project-

- Detect faces
- Classify into Male/Female
- Classify into one of the 8 age ranges
- Put the results on the image and display it
