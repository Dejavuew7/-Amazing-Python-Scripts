### Introduction:
- Face mask detection had seen significant progress in the domains of Image processing and Computer vision, since the rise of the Covid-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been created using several algorithms and techniques. The approach in this project uses deep learning, TensorFlow, Keras, and OpenCV to detect face masks.
- Convolutional Neural Network, Data augmentation are the key to this project.
