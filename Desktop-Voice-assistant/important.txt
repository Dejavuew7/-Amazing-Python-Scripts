Here for making the sent Email function work, there are certain changes that should be made
   in respective device or else the function won't work and a error will pop up
For the function to work:
   1. In google search "Less secured apps in gmail"
   2. Select "Control access to less secure apps"
   3. Here enable the less secure apps for the account you will be using to send emails

Now its a concern of security if we have to write our password this way
    for no privacy breach we can use the following steps:
    1. Go to goole and search "App passwords google"
    2. Open "App passwords-Sign in Google"
    3. Sign in the with the account you want to use for sending emails using this
    4.Under "select the app and device you want generate password for"
         i> Select App= Mail   Select Device= Windows 10
         ii>Click on generate
    5. Copy the app password and use it here.
