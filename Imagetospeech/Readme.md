## Image To Speech Functionalities : 🚀

- There are two parts :
   1) The first script image_to_text.py. In this the user gives the input of the image path
      and the script converts the image to text file.
   2) The second script text_to_speech.py. This script directly converts the text file of the first
      script to speech file or mp3 file.

- The scripts run depending on the user requirement
