Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction with EDA and Neural Network(Sequential)

Description:
Concrete Compressive Strength Prediction using deep learning (keras). The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. Predicts the actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under specific age (days) was determined from laboratory.Also Includes performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
