# Backup Generator 

The "File Backup Script" is a Python script designed to create a backup of files from a source directory and store them in a destination directory. The script uses the shutil and os modules to perform file operations and timestamp the backup folders. Below are the details on how to use this script

# Working

In the backup_files function, you need to specify the source directory and destination directory:
- Replace /path/to/source_directory with the path to the directory containing the files you want to back up.
- Replace /path/to/destination_directory with the path to the directory where the backup files should be stored.

# Requirements

- os
- shutil
